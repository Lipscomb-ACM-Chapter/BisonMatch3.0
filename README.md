#Bison Match 3.0


1. Install django version 2.0.2

2. Install the mysqlclient:

    pip3 install mysqlclient

(Possibly migrate the db, gotta check on this.)

3. To run the development server:

    python3 manage.py runserver

    If it is all correct,

    127.0.0.1:8000/bisonMatch/about/ should show you the names currently in the db



Notes:

Use python3 to avoid confusion.
