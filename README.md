## Setting up Paypal

Here are some steps to take to set up Paypal on your localhost.

1. Login to the Paypal's sandbox part of the site [here](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts/)
2. Click on **My Apps & Credentials** on the lefthand side under **Dashboard**.
  * Click onto the BisonMatch App
3. Click **Add Webhook**. This is where Paypal will attempt to make the POST to once it completes the transaction.
  * Add the full address of the link to send the POST request to. Something like https://localhost:8000/bisonMatch/thanks

Now Paypal should be able to send a POST to the correct place. Next we have to create the button for the website, and this does have
to be specific in order for it to work.

1. Login to the regula Paypal site [here](https://www.paypal.com/us/home)
2. In the main navigation bar hover over **Tools**, then select **All Tools** in the dropdown.
3. Scroll down and select **Paypal Buttons**
4. Select the **Buy Now** button.
5. Fill in the *Item Name* and *Price* then scroll down and select *Step 3*.
6. Check the boxes **Take customers to this URL when they cancel** and **Take customers to this URL when they finish checkout** and add the appropriate
locations.
7. Check the **Advance Variables** box and type in:

```
notify_url=https://myapp.com/url_to_notify
```

8. Create the button and add the code.


# Notes:

Use python3 to avoid confusion.
